# AgentFlow SDLC Definition

AgentFlow SDLC Definition is the product authority for agentic delivery. It defines the shared model used by roles, agents, skills, validators, migrations, audits, and Cockpit.

Machine-readable vocabulary lives in `sdlc.config.json`. Portable evidence and boundary contracts
are defined in [evidence-contracts.md](evidence-contracts.md) and
[lifecycle-boundaries.md](lifecycle-boundaries.md). Executable behavioral checks and derived,
non-authoritative outcome projections are defined in [agent-evals.md](agent-evals.md) and
[outcome-metrics.md](outcome-metrics.md).

## Authority model

- Human authority: `docs/sdlc-definition.md`.
- Machine authority: `sdlc.config.json`.
- Schema contract: `schemas/sdlc-config.schema.json`.
- Execution adapter: `agent-workflow.config.json` owns branch strategy, validation commands, routing,
  provider/source bindings, enabled extensions, and adoption preferences. It does not own domain
  vocabulary.

Harness-specific directories such as `.pi`, `.claude`, `.agy`, and `.codex` are generated adapter surfaces only. They are never canonical product source.

## Core concepts

| Concept                | Meaning                                                                | Durable sources                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace              | Configured repository/project boundary                                 | config, Cockpit query state                 |
| Goal Group             | Parent objective/epic                                                  | issue body, relationships                   |
| Goal                   | Delivery objective with acceptance                                     | issue body, labels, comments                |
| Delivery               | Implementation and PR activity                                         | PR, commits, checks                         |
| Role Flow              | Ordered role contributions and returns                                 | role-pass, workflow-status, handover        |
| Readiness              | Path-aware applicable quality state                                    | issue/PR evidence, checks                   |
| Release                | Target, impact, assignment, released/unreleased state                  | issue fields, milestone, PR/release records |
| Human approval gate    | Explicit human decision required by high-assurance work                | PR review or gate record                    |
| Follow-up              | Deferred work tracked as issue                                         | follow-up issue links                       |
| Source                 | External durable record link                                           | `SourceAdapter` artifact references         |
| Guided workflow action | Preview-first safe update to durable workflow records                  | Cockpit/action audit                        |
| Cockpit                | Optional first-class Goal Command Center projecting durable SDLC state | source adapter and CLI records              |

GitHub is the first and default `SourceAdapter`. AgentFlow core remains source-neutral, and product
language leads with AgentFlow concepts.

Cockpit is an official optional projection of this model. It may visualize goals, readiness, role flow, release state, replay, approvals, and follow-ups, but it must not own unique SDLC state or be required by adoption, validators, skills, plugins, or settings merge.

## Paths

Canonical workflow profiles:

- `bounded`: low-risk, narrow work; self-review allowed; optional architecture/product/docs roles may be skipped with reason.
- `standard`: default delivery path; architecture, implementation, validation, review, and PR readiness required.
- `high-assurance`: security/production/data-risk path; all roles required; self-review forbidden; human approval gate required.
- `exploratory`: research/QA/discovery path; implementation roles may be optional until delivery begins.

Rules:

- Path is selected before implementation.
- Skipped-by-path roles are excluded from readiness denominator.
- Skips require reason.
- Escalate to `high-assurance` when security, auth, data migration, production deployment, customer data, or explicit policy demands it.

## Role flow

The product catalog maps the workflow slugs to qualified identities such as
`agentflow:product-manager`, `agentflow:implementation-planner`, `agentflow:reviewer`, and
`agentflow:technical-writer`. See
[`roles/index.md`](roles/index.md). Roles are accountability contracts; actors execute them, skills
supply capabilities, and method plays customize how they operate.

Canonical sequence:

0. Product manager
1. Analyst
2. Architect
3. Implementation planner
4. Developer
5. Tester
6. Reviewer
7. Technical writer
8. PR readiness

Allowed returns:

- Developer -> Implementation planner for planning defect.
- Reviewer -> Developer for review findings.
- Technical writer -> Developer for docs remediation.
- PR readiness → Developer for merge blocker.

Each role pass records issue, branch, role, profile, owner/executor/provenance, inputs read, decisions, uncertainty, validation, next-role contract, status, and signature.

## Labels and lifecycle

Label groups:

- Type/domain: `epic`, `feature`, `bug`, `dx`, `tooling`, `documentation`, `qa`, `exploratory`.
- Routing: `for-implementation:<agent>`.
- Lifecycle: `drafted-by:<agent>`, `implemented-by:<agent>`, `for-review:<agent>`, `reviewed-by:<agent>`.
- Integration/release: `integrated:<branch>`, `awaiting-release`.
- Test debt: `needs-test`.

Rules:

- New issues need one primary type/domain label.
- Agent provenance labels are factual audit metadata.
- Deprecated `agent:*` labels are forbidden for new work.
- Labels do not replace role-pass evidence.

## Gateways

| Gate                | Owner                         | Required evidence                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Issue readiness     | PM/Analyst                    | title, labels, acceptance, scope         |
| Phase transition    | current role                  | role-pass + allowed transition           |
| Validation          | Tester                        | command/manual validation evidence       |
| Review              | Reviewer                      | findings, independence boundary          |
| Human approval      | human/reviewer                | reviewer, scope, decision, notes         |
| PR readiness        | PR readiness                  | manifest, validation, review, follow-ups |
| Release readiness   | Technical writer/PR readiness | release assignment, notes, blockers      |
| Guided action write | action gateway                | preview, auth, CSRF, confirmation, audit |

Human approval gate record:

```md
## Human approval gate

Reviewer: @login
Scope: security | acceptance | release | other
Decision: approved | changes-requested | blocked
Notes: ...
```

## Release model

Release candidate sources:

1. Explicit issue fields: `Release: vX.Y.Z`, `Target release: vX.Y.Z`, `Version: vX.Y.Z`.
2. Milestone title exactly matching release version.

Incidental semver in package versions, logs, runtime output, or prose is ignored.

Release assignment states:

- `assigned`: release-impact goal has target release.
- `needs-assignment`: release-impact goal lacks target release.
- `released`: delivered/closed and not awaiting release.
- `no-release-impact`: explicitly excluded.

Release filters:

- `unreleased`
- `released`
- `all`
- `needs-assignment`
- future specific version filters

## Evidence envelopes

Cross-harness state should use deterministic markdown envelopes when recording structured state.

````md
<!-- [AGENTFLOW-ROLE-PASS-v1] -->

```json
{
  "issue": 123,
  "role": "developer",
  "profile": "standard",
  "executor": "agy-cli",
  "transport": "local-cli",
  "delegationBoundary": "current-session",
  "status": "pass"
}
```

<!-- [/AGENTFLOW-ROLE-PASS-v1] -->
````

Rules:

- Envelopes supplement human prose; they do not hide decisions.
- Parsers must ignore malformed envelopes and report audit findings.
- Do not include raw prompts, transcripts, secrets, full logs, or tool payloads.

## Extension policy

Adopting projects may extend:

- roles
- paths
- labels
- gates
- validators
- harness adapters
- release policies

Extensions must:

- declare owner and compatibility.
- preserve role-pass provenance.
- preserve high-assurance human approval.
- preserve readiness denominator rules.
- provide validator or explicit non-automatable rationale.
- avoid hidden TODOs.
- keep product source out of harness-specific generated directories.

Extensions must not:

- weaken high-assurance gates silently.
- claim multi-agent work without attribution.
- treat source systems as primary product concepts.
- derive release candidate from incidental semver.
- store secrets/raw transcripts/full logs as durable evidence.

## Harness contract

Every harness follows:

```text
hydrate -> act -> validate -> flush
```

- Hydrate latest durable state.
- Act within selected path and role ownership.
- Validate with deterministic commands.
- Flush structured evidence to durable surfaces.

Agent slug is not execution target. Record launcher, executor, transport, delegation boundary, context boundary, model/runtime, and independence boundary where applicable.

## Production validators

Required command surface:

- `validate-sdlc-config`
- `validate-sdlc-issue`
- `validate-sdlc-role-pass`
- `validate-sdlc-pr`
- `validate-sdlc-release`
- `validate-sdlc-skill`
- `validate-sdlc-agent`

Validators emit human-readable output and `--json` where useful.

## Verifiable delivery and recovery

New run acceptance uses a frozen v2 evidence policy. Deterministic criteria require source-resolved observations for the current candidate and check definition, in addition to the accountable role decision. Unknown writer status, unresolved external effects and open rework block unsafe advancement or transfer. Runtime policy remains `sdlc.config.json.deliveryPolicy`; operational commands, inputs and source bindings live in `agent-workflow.config.json.delivery`. See [ADR 007](adr/007-verifiable-recoverable-delivery.md) and [reliable delivery](reliable-delivery.md).
