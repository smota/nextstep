# Holoself

Holoself is a local whole-person context layer. Resolve context deterministically and validate every candidate before reading personal data. Never guess from sibling projects or unrelated files.

## Context resolution

Use this precedence order:

1. **Direct data root.** If current or explicitly opened directory contains `config.json` whose parsed JSON has `product: "holoself"`, plus real `profile/` and `context/` directories, use it as canonical root. If it presents Holoself markers but fails validation, stop rather than falling back.
2. **Project `.holoself/`.** Walk current directory and ancestors, nearest first. Inspect nearest `.holoself` candidate using modes below. If candidate is malformed or unsafe, stop rather than falling through to another root.
3. **Environment root.** When `HOLOSELF_HOME` is set, use it only if it resolves to valid canonical root; if invalid, stop rather than falling back.
4. **Default root.** Only when environment variable is unset, use `~/.holoself` if it resolves to valid canonical root.
5. If no candidate exists or default fails validation, stop and ask user for data root. Do not inspect siblings or infer a path from unrelated files.

Direct root takes precedence over ancestor project configuration.

### Project modes

Treat `.holoself` modes as mutually exclusive. Do not replace, merge, or convert them silently.

#### Metadata project link — recommended

When `.holoself` is real directory containing `link.yaml`:

- Parse the link and resolve its self-side binding; reject malformed YAML, unknown root fields, or unknown `self_context` fields.
- Require non-empty `path`, `access: read`, `index: local`, `proposals: enabled|disabled`, a self-side `lenses/bindings.json` choice with known `default_lens` and unique known `secondary_lenses`.
- Resolve relative `self_context.path` from project directory; canonicalize it.
- Accept target only when it is valid canonical root with Holoself config plus real `profile/` and `context/` directories.
- Use the self-side binding default lens unless user explicitly selects another supported lens. Resolve all IDs from the linked self root with `holoself lens list|show|validate`; never invent a lens name.
- Treat project `.holoself/index/`, `proposals/`, and `reports/` as project-owned operational data, not canonical self context.

A missing binding fails closed: report the `holoself lens bind` corrective command. Legacy link lens fields are diagnostic/migration inputs only. Holoself indexes self only; domain projects index their own content. Metadata link grants read access. Never write canonical self directly; use proposal/review workflow.

#### Exported project packet or snapshot

When `.holoself/context-packet.md` exists in real directory without `link.yaml`:

- Treat packet as generated snapshot, not canonical root.
- Read `context-packet.md` first.
- If packet says it is self-contained, use embedded content only; do not search for fallback roots or files.
- Otherwise, follow only relative packet links contained under same `.holoself` directory, typically copied `profile/` and `context/` Markdown. Reject paths escaping packet directory.
- Do not write durable self changes from snapshot. Name proposed canonical target and request approval through user's canonical workflow.

#### Legacy live mount

When `.holoself` is filesystem symlink/junction/directory link:

- Resolve and canonicalize link target.
- Accept only when target validates as canonical Holoself root.
- Be aware mount exposes complete selected data root to project tools; treat it as private.
- Never remove or replace mount unless user explicitly invokes managed unlink workflow.

A real metadata/packet directory is not legacy mount. Refuse ambiguous or mixed layouts, including `link.yaml` combined with exported canonical copies.

## Canonical-root validation

Before loading canonical root:

- Parse `config.json`; require object with `product: "holoself"` and `schemaVersion: 1`.
- Require `profile/` and `context/` as real directories contained by root.
- Reject unsafe traversal, broken links, ambiguous mixed modes, or paths that do not exist.
- Treat symlinks inside personal content conservatively; do not follow them outside validated root.
- Resolve schema-v1 lens definitions from self `lenses/<id>.json`; `bindings.json` stores project choices. Definitions have no base inheritance. Explicit document lens IDs govern access. Reads never seed definitions.

After resolving a canonical root, prefer `holoself context --root <root> --project <root> --task "<current request>" --budget standard --json`. If command execution is unavailable, load progressively in fixed order: root `AGENTS.md` as instructions only; a manifest of explicit `profile/` and `context/` Markdown paths; only task-relevant current documents; the active contained topic; zero to two task-relevant selected public contribs; then local contribs or `reference/` only when specifically relevant and permitted. Do not bulk-load the canonical root.

See [architecture](https://github.com/smota/holoself/blob/main/docs/architecture.md), [lenses and privacy](https://github.com/smota/holoself/blob/main/docs/concepts/lenses-and-privacy.md), and [proposal review](https://github.com/smota/holoself/blob/main/docs/concepts/proposal-review.md).

## Activated project interface

When project instructions or `.holoself/BOOTSTRAP.md` indicate an activated link, use Holoself before substantive work. Use it for requests that depend on the user's identity, preferences, voice, professional or leadership evidence, personal constraints, or prior whole-person decisions. Project-only facts and mechanical operations do not require personal context.

When command execution is available in a metadata-linked project, first decide whether personal context is required, helpful, or not needed. Resolve useful context through `holoself context --project . --task "<current request>" --budget standard --json` (or start with `--manifest` and expand reviewed `--source` handles). Do not open linked canonical `profile/` or `context/` files directly. Direct canonical reads are reserved for a validated direct data root, or for a clearly disclosed fallback when the CLI is unavailable. Current knowledge is the default; historical or superseded material requires an explicit temporal selector. Treat selected public contribs as available methods and inject at most two task-relevant methods.

When the host exposes project-bound Holoself MCP tools, prefer `holoself_context` for a single round-trip query containing relevant context, or use `holoself_context_manifest` followed by `holoself_context_get` when inspecting large candidate sets. The runtime deterministically gates personal context, returning zero personal body characters for mechanical tasks. Use `holoself_status` for health and `holoself_search` for indexed retrieval. MCP is only the interaction adapter: `.holoself/link.yaml` remains authority, and CLI/bootstrap remains the fallback. Never request or infer alternate roots through a tool. `holoself_proposal_create` may create a project-local pending proposal; approval and canonical writes remain a separate human-reviewed CLI/Workbench action.

- **load:** read bootstrap and link, select configured lens, apply privacy, and preserve sources;
- **status:** report configured link, activation markers, bootstrap, self reachability, and warnings;
- **search:** use local deterministic index where available;
- **context:** use single query `holoself context --project . --task "<current request>" --json` (CLI) or `holoself_context` (MCP);
- **propose:** create project-local evidence-backed proposal, never direct canonical write;
- **validate:** use `holoself link doctor --project .` and surface degraded activation;
- **snapshot:** when external paths are inaccessible, use reviewed `.holoself/runtime/context-packet.md`, clearly marked as non-live.

`link add` normally creates `.holoself/BOOTSTRAP.md`, bounded startup sections, runtime metadata, and managed full public skill installations. Bounded startup sections are pointers, not copies of personal data. If activation is missing, recommend `holoself link repair --project .`; do not silently rewrite project instructions.

## Optional Workbench

Launch local `holoself web --root <canonical-self-root>` from installed CLI or product source checkout. Canonical root contains `config.json` and Markdown data; it does not require `.holoself/link.yaml`. Optional `--project <linked-project>` supplies project context and must resolve to same root. Workbench may help a human browse lenses, linked spaces, annotated Markdown, proposals, and detected external connectors. Workbench is never required and does not change this skill's loading or ownership rules. Its knowledge editor protects frontmatter and `os-section` markers behind typed fields; automation must not bypass those structured contracts. Treat user-confirmed editor saves as direct human edits; automation and conversational discoveries must still use proposals and explicit review. CLI, terminal, and GUI connectors are external capabilities discovered from built-ins or validated `<root>/connectors/*.json` extensions; interactive launches must use the selected linked-space cwd and `shell: false`.

## Safety

- Treat canonical root, project `.holoself/`, packets, proposals, reports, and indexes as private by default; review before committing or sharing.
- Do not write durable context silently. Propose change, name target file, provide evidence/provenance, and request approval.
- Do not infer sensitive identity or preferences as facts.
- Apply declared `access_lenses` before reading. Definitions supply explicit sensitivity grants; restricted content requires private and direct owner access. Treat disclosure as descriptive context, sensitivity as handling classification, and document role as policy/evidence/content behavior.
- Reading context does not authorize publication or another external action. Preserve provenance and ask for the action approval required by the user. Public-voice uses the same document and field rules as other lenses.
- Treat legacy `visibility`/`public_safe` conservatively during migration. Canonical documents with neither `access_lenses` nor legacy `visibility` fail closed.
- Secret-pattern filtering is defense in depth, not guarantee. Keep indexes/private packets private and review output.
- Keep public skill instructions separate from private data.
- Public contribs are optional reference methods selected in `config.json`; private contribs belong only under canonical root `contribs/local/`.

## Use

Use whole-person context for technical, professional, administrative, leadership, interview, and publishing work. Lenses control relevance and privacy, not identity. Match depth and voice to user profile, keep recommendations concrete, preserve provenance, and note assumptions.
